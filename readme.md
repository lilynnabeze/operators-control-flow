    subtraction operator - (-);
    division operator - (/);
    increment operator- (++);
    decrement operator - (--);
    modulus operator - (%);
    multiplication operator - (*);
    exponentiation operator - (**)

Assignment Operators (=):
    addition assignment operator - (+=);
    multiplication assignment operator - (*=);
    subtraction assignment operator - (-=);
    division assignment operator - (/=);
    modulus assignment operator - (%=)

Comparison Operators:

    less than - (<);
    less than or equal to - (<=)
    loose equality operator - (==);
    strict equality operator - (===);
    not equals operator - (!==)

Logical Operators:
    AND - (&&);
    OR - (||);

QUESTION 2:
Arithmetric Operators examples:
    console.log(1 + 2);
    console.log(2 ** 2);

Assignment Operators examples:
    let x = 7
    x += 5

Comparison Operators examples:
    console.log(1 > 2)
    console.log(2 <= 3)

Logical Operators examples:
    let theSkyIsBlue = true;
    let theSeaIsGreen = false;
    let eligibiltyToPass = theSkyIsBlue && theSeaIsGreen;
    console.log(eligibilityToPass)  

    let theSkyIsBlue = true;
    let theSeaIsGreen = false;
    let eligibiltyToPass = theSkyIsBlue || theSeaIsGreen;
    console.log(eligibilityToPass)
